# FEND Arcade Game

Hey there! 
Welcome to the preliminary version of the classic "frogger" game. Because its not going to a frogger for long.. 
But for now, welcome to udacity's frogger project game.

This project was built using OOJS (object-oriented javascript) + HTML5 canvas

Objective:
You have to get the little kid from one side of the canvas to the other....
And just do it again a couple more times. You'll be able to do that if you avoid the bugs while navigating the canvas. 

How to Download to Play:
*if you're using Github:
you can: a/ download this repo 
         b/fork the code
*if you're uncomfortable or unfamiliar to the Github environment then:
you can: download the zip folder containing the folders that run the game. 

both should yield the same result of having the index.html file at hand (or at desktop lol)
from there you can open it up in the browser and play away! 

How to Play:
"A"- Left
"S" - Down
"D" - Right
"W" - Up
