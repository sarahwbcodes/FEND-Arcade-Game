# FEND Arcade Game

Hey there! 
Welcome to the preliminary version of the classic "frogger" game. Because its not going to a frogger for long.. 
But for now, welcome to udacity's frogger project game.

This project was built using OOJS (object-oriented javascript) + HTML5 canvas

Objective:
You have to get the little kid from one side of the canvas to the other....
And just do it again a couple more times. You'll be able to do that if you avoid the bugs while navigating the canvas. 

How to Play:
"A"- Left
"S" - Down
"D" - Right
"W" - Up
